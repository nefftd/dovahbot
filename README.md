# Dovahbot

An extensible IRC bot written in Lua. 

Still in early pre-prototype stages.

### Planned Features

- (Tentative) Support all versions of Lua from 5.1 through 5.3, incl. LuaJIT.
- (Tentative) Fully compliant implementation of the IRC protocol, version 3.1 (probably will be spun into an independent IRC lib when finished).
- Simple callback-based API for developing modules.
- (Tentative) Feature-parity (or close to it) with many existing IRC bots slated for version 1.0.
- (Tentative) Flexible user account system with permission levels, and access controls on a per-module basis.
- Full administration over IRC commands, or over command line interface, in addition to human-readable plain text configuration.
- (Extremely tentative) Language-agnostic protocol for writing modules in any language. (Likely to be scrapped, but we'll see.)
